This is a collection of scripts and registry hacks to improve/customize Windows 10 UI. 

Some of these were written by me, and some were borrowed from various places around the internet (such as [[tenforums]](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/) or from people in the Windows ricing community). I've tried to include credit where I could. Since these communities are enthuasist focused they don't generally use git, or even maintain actual repos etc, so I've tried to do the best I could to both collect the things I've found useful and also to start forming it into a repository that other people who are interested can contribute or build off of.
